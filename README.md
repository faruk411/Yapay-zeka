# Fake News Detection

We used the fake_or_real_news dataset by Katharine Jarmul. It consists of 6339 data, half of which is fake news and the other half is real news. I applied the classification method in this model, I applied the MultinomialNB and SGDClassifier classification models. In MultinomialNB, I got the accuracy value: 0.84 and SGDClassifier: 0.88.
